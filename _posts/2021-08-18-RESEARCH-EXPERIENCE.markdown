      <p><strong>Balancing real-world inverted pendulums via virtual training with RL | Jul 2021- Present</strong></p>
      <p><em>Advisor: Hien Tran, Professor and Associate Head at Department of Mathematics, North Carolina State University</em></p>
      <ui>
        <li>Implemented Policy Gradient, Actor Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization with Pytorch and successfully balanced the single inverted pendulum in a modified gym environment which provides a more realistic simulation of physical laws.</li>
        <li>Successfully balanced the double inverted pendulum by using Actor Critic in a modified gym environment.</li>
        <li>Successfully applied our trained model in the gym to balance a real single inverted pendulum in the lab.</li>
        <li>Trying to directly apply our trained model in the gym to balance a real double inverted pendulum in the lab.</li>
