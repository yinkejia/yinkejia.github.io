      <p><strong>Checkerboard recognition and game algorithm of gobang | Dec 2020 - Jan 2021</strong></p>
      <p><em>Advisor: Zhiwei Zhang, Professor at School of Computer Science, Beijing Institute of Technology</em></p>
      <ui>
        <li>Implemented CNNs for checkerboard recognition with Pytorch.</li>
        <li>Implemented gobang AI algorithms based on the minimax search strategies, evolutionary algorithms, and deep Q-Learning (in Tensorflow).</li>
        <li>Wrote a report to analyze the results of the experiments above. The gobang AI based on minimax search and Deep Q-Learning approaches achieved good performance which is comparable to humansâ€™.</li>
