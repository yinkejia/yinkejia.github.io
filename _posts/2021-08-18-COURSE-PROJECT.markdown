      <p>Project Title:<em>Can Diffusion Model Generalize Well in Image Super Resolution with Limited Fine-Tuning?</em></p>
      <ui>
        <li>Fine-tuned a pretrained SR3 model with limited update steps, amount of data and time steps on a new data domain which are unseen during pretraining.</li>
        <li>Verified the pretrained model’s generalization ability qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS.</li>
        <li>Wrote a report in a conference format and made a poster presentation.<a href="/assets/documents/CSC2529_Project.pdf" target="_blank">[report]</a></li>

      <p><strong>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence | BIT | Dec 2020 - Jan 2021</strong></p>
      <ui>
        <li>Implemented CNNs for checkerboard recognition with Pytorch.</li>
        <li>Implemented gobang AI algorithms based on the minimax search strategies, evolutionary algorithms, and deep Q-Learning.</li>
        <li>Wrote a report to analyze the results of the experiments above. The gobang AI based on minimax search and Deep Q-Learning approaches achieved good performance which is comparable to humans’.</li>
